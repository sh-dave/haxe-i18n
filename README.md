i18n
====

i18n is a macro driven internationalization/localization toolkit for Haxe.

### Localization quick tour

1. ```using i18n.I18n```
2. Add '.i18n()' after all string literals to be externalized
3. Build your project, strings will be extracted to "i18n_work/default/strings.xml", under your project root directory
4. Then you can do translating based on strings.xml and store the translations into "i18n_work/&lt;locale&gt;/" folders
5. Specify the target locale with macro compiler option I18n.locale(), e.g.: "--macro i18n.I18n.locale('zh')"
6. Rebuild the project, this time I18n will look up the corresponding translation and replace the original string literals with the translated version

### Internationalization quick tour:

Almost the same procedure with localization, except two:

1. In step 5, simply use 'global' for the locale argument. This will build a multilingual application.
2. After I18n.init(), detect and set the desired locale, e.g.: I18n.setCurrentLocale(flash.system.Capabilities.language);

### Macro compiler options

I18n.locale(loc: String): set target locale, 'default', 'global' & arbitary custom locales e.g. 'zh', 'fr', can be used.

I18n.assets(path: String): set the output assets folder, by default it's "assets/i18n". The folder is for storing all locale sensitive resource files.

To set compiler options in NME project, simply add two lines in NMML file, e.g.:
```xml
    <compilerflag name="--macro com.roxstudio.i18n.I18n.locale('zh')" />
    <compilerflag name="--macro com.roxstudio.i18n.I18n.assets('res/i18n')" />
```

### The underneath code substitution

Assume I have original "i18n_work/default/strings.xml" like this:
```xml
<strings>
  <file path="Main.hx">
    <t id="Hello">Hello</t><!--line 12-->
  </file>
</strings>
```
And the Chinese translation is ready at "i18n_work/zh/strings.xml", like this:
```xml
<strings>
  <file path="Main.hx">
    <t id="Hello">你好</t>
  </file>
</strings>
```

When I target 'zh' locale and build the project, the original haxe code in Main.hx:
```haxe
textfield.text = "Hello".i18n();
```
will be transformed to (at compile-time):
```haxe
textfield.text = "你好";
```
When I target 'global' locale and build the project, the code will be transformed to:
```haxe
textfield.text = Global.str(0);
```
Global.str() is a run-time method for quick-access to the string mapping.

### Launch-time locale switching

While using 'global' locale, your app will gain the capability of launch-time locale switching. E.g.:
```haxe
    I18n.init();
    I18n.setCurrentLocale(flash.system.Capabilities.language);
```
If the desired locale is not supported, then it will fallback to 'default'.

### Run-time locale switching

Run-time locale switching is a little bit more tricky then launch-time approach, normally it needs to do some extra operations to handle the string changes,
e.g. UI refreshing etc. Here's the approach used by I18n.
```haxe
    var textfield = new TextField();
    I18n.onChange(textfield.text = 'Hello'.i18n());
```
This will be transformd to:
```haxe
    var textfield = new TextField();
    var __i18n_callb__ = function() { textfield.text = Global.str(0); }
    Global.addListener("current code location", __i18n_callb__);
    __i18n_callb__();
```
And the "__i18n_callb__" will be invoked again if Global.setCurrentLocale() get called.
